# weather-prediction

This project was made for the Scientific Computing Class (COMP260) at Wesleyan University. 

Our project had to cover three areas of focus out of everything we studied throughout the semester. 
My three areas of focus are : 
- Timeseries analysis 
- Scikit Learn 
- TensorFlow 

The goal of this project was to look at what someone with a good programming and computer science background but with almost no data science background should do to make a simple temperature predictor.
The main question here was should we implement a simple Linear Regression or use a Deep Neural Network?
