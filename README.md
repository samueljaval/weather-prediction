# weather-prediction

This project was made for the Scientific Computing Class (COMP260) at Wesleyan University. 

Our project had to cover three areas of focus out of everything we studied throughout the semester. 
My three areas of focus are : 
- Timeseries analysis 
- Scikit Learn 
- TensorFlow 

The goal of this project was to look at what someone with a good programming and computer science background but with almost no data science background should do to make a simple temperature predictor. The main question here was should we implement a simple Linear Regression or use a Deep Neural Network? 

The project contains 3 files : 
- getData.ipynb
- linearRegression.ipynb
- deepNeuralNetwork.ipynb

The first file of the project is getData.ipynb. This file is where we get our data. Getting data is arguably the most important part of data science. I didn't want to use a pre-made dataset that I could find online (on Kaggle for example) so I used the online weather API to get my data. 

The second file of the project linearRegression.ipynb is where we do our Linear Regression to predict the temperature from our data. We do this Linear Regression using the Scikit Learn Python Library. 

The third file of the project deepNeuralNetwork.ipynb is where we try to predict the weather with a deep Neural Network using the TensorFlow High Level API.
